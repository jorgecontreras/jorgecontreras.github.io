# Kubernetes CKAD Certification study notes

## Who is it for?

This certification is for Kubernetes engineers, cloud engineers and other IT professionals responsible for building, deploying, and configuring cloud native applications with Kubernetes.

## Purpose

The Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) can design, build and deploy cloud-native applications for Kubernetes.
A CKAD can define application resources and use Kubernetes core primitives to create/migrate, configure, expose and observe scalable applications.
The exam assumes working knowledge of container runtimes and microservice architecture.

A [complete guide](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/certified-kubernetes-application/9780138086558/) to learning how to run Kubernetes applications and pass the CKAD exam

**Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) Exam Prep Labs**

By O'Reilly Media Editorial

This collection of [interactive labs](https://learning.oreilly.com/playlists/2e9fe6dc-2a05-47fe-ae0a-34d6485287cc) provides hands-on training that enhances the exam prep guidance in Benjamin Muschko's Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) Study Guide, second edition, which walks you through the topics you need to understand for the CKAD exam.

**Kubernetes Book Club**

I'm also participating in the [Kubernetes Virtual Book Club](https://community.cncf.io/kubernetes-virtual-book-club/) hosted by CNCF. This book club is a great way to connect with other learners, discuss Kubernetes-related topics, and gain deeper insights into cloud-native practices. It's a valuable resource for preparing for the CKAD exam, as we explore Kubernetes concepts in a collaborative environment, share experiences, and solve problems together.

If youâ€™re preparing for a Kubernetes certification or just want to learn more about cloud-native technologies, I highly recommend joining the book club.
